common_voice_lv_19538861.mp3	He just spent one and twenty euros on a new nightie for his wife.	dev
common_voice_lv_19538867.mp3	That’s a powerful combination.	dev
common_voice_lv_19538868.mp3	I thought that that was it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19538869.mp3	He’d like to go to bed.	dev

common_voice_lv_19538907.mp3	I think that you’ll be pleased.	dev
common_voice_lv_19538908.mp3	No... Nothing.	dev
common_voice_lv_19538909.mp3	I probably got it mixed up. Guilty, Jānis.	dev

common_voice_lv_19397094.mp3	What you’re late for today, you’ll never catch up on.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397095.mp3	A dead giraffe. A big house.	dev

common_voice_lv_19397108.mp3	Wait. What?	dev
common_voice_lv_19397109.mp3	Really! That’s why I though familiar faces.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397110.mp3	They’re considered armed and very dangerous.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397111.mp3	I wanted to say the same thing.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397117.mp3	My existence is inevitable.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397118.mp3	Sitting under a blanket and counting beans.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397119.mp3	But I know that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397120.mp3	Screeching like an unoiled wagon.	dev

common_voice_lv_19397122.mp3	Strength and health are a person’s biggest joy.	dev

common_voice_lv_19397136.mp3	What is supposed to think? What will it lead to?	dev
common_voice_lv_19397142.mp3	My best friend since the age of eight.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397143.mp3	Why can’t you accept that?	dev
common_voice_lv_19397144.mp3	We need to test a few more movement reflexes.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397145.mp3	They want to know what he has in mind.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397146.mp3	Red hair, tall.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397147.mp3	In my opinion, there’s been more than one dispute.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397148.mp3	John lied to you for many years.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397149.mp3	I got goosebumps!	dev
common_voice_lv_19397150.mp3	Why do you ask?	dev
common_voice_lv_19397151.mp3	You’re afraid of letting yourself be happy.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397157.mp3	I’ll drive over earlier and get the kids’ room ready.	dev

common_voice_lv_19397176.mp3	What are you going to rescue?	dev
common_voice_lv_19397192.mp3	Me? That’s impossible.	dev

common_voice_lv_19397240.mp3	I want you to look at it through a telescope - together with me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397241.mp3	Behind this wall.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397249.mp3	Strange. I’ve only got gray ones.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397252.mp3	At the age of thirty five, you’re still afraid of thunder.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397254.mp3	He doesn’t say that, it’s not true.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397256.mp3	I was programmed to protect Sarah Connor. I will not stop.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397257.mp3	One has to choose the highest level.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397267.mp3	A beautiful house.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397268.mp3	It’s cold everywhere if you’re naked; if you’re lazy, it’s tough everywhere.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397269.mp3	You’re not a polite guest are you?	dev
common_voice_lv_19397270.mp3	He who doesn’t know shame, will not die hungry.	dev
common_voice_lv_19397271.mp3	Yes indeed.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402572.mp3	Or something like that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402573.mp3	I don’t see him!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402574.mp3	It’s going to be awkward.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402575.mp3	I’m alone, the size of the bed doesn’t matter.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402576.mp3	What’s she doing?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402582.mp3	I swear I don’t know why the nappy was stolen.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402586.mp3	You’re wrong. How can you say that?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402592.mp3	I’m something more.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402593.mp3	He’s nice, that’s an extra plus.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402594.mp3	Whatever you’ve undertaken, do it to completion.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402595.mp3	He’s the first official grand oligarch.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402596.mp3	You’d better not get involved.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402609.mp3	I’m teasing you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402610.mp3	You’re right.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402611.mp3	You said that all the other people died, right?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402619.mp3	You shouldn’t do that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402620.mp3	We’re hostages.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402622.mp3	We’re in the atmosphere.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402624.mp3	His wife left him and six months later he was dead.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402626.mp3	What will we announce?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402635.mp3	Did you all go to the hockey game?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402637.mp3	Learned to differentiate good from evil.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402639.mp3	Maybe that can’t be done.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402641.mp3	I saw a dream.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402642.mp3	He who’s afraid of sweat will never see the benefit.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402643.mp3	We’ve got such a beautiful relationship.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402644.mp3	He brought two wives and forty two million in gold bars.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402645.mp3	Don’t tease me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402646.mp3	He who climbs onto a sleigh, rides on one.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402647.mp3	You’re colleagues. I contracted him as soon as I heard about his education.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402648.mp3	Exactly.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402649.mp3	I’ve got a lot of friends.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402650.mp3	I’d like a warm pie and ice cream.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402651.mp3	I’ll let you and the others think about the slogan while I think up the message.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402712.mp3	At three in the morning, I sent a message to be beaten up.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402713.mp3	The ability to fly is not important here.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402714.mp3	Without rain there’s no fecundity, without tears there’s no joy.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402715.mp3	To Hell with it. Good.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402716.mp3	I’m fine right here.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402722.mp3	Mum, a chocolate cocktail in a hurry!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402723.mp3	If you think you’ll brush him aside with lies, you’re mad.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402728.mp3	He’s a treat to us all.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402729.mp3	A natural reaction.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402730.mp3	Have you got a headache?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402731.mp3	This month’s reports.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402732.mp3	He who envies someone else’s happiness will never find his own.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402733.mp3	And now disappear.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402734.mp3	He’s twelve years old.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402735.mp3	Go away.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402736.mp3	Is everything correct? I’m listening.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402742.mp3	He’s the only person who’s always been at my side.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402743.mp3	Good. The bigger the pride, the lower the fall.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402744.mp3	Open the bag and pour everything out, nice and slowly.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402754.mp3	Let’s drop down, it’s another couple of meters to the balcony.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402771.mp3	I remember.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402782.mp3	He’s not aged. Not by a hair since I met him back in eighty four.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402783.mp3	What was the worst? The tattoo?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402784.mp3	When the time comes, we’ll talk about it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402785.mp3	You really want to meet him.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402796.mp3	Give me a basket of eggs.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402798.mp3	Greetings!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402799.mp3	I’m not interested in the apartment.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402876.mp3	Maybe I’m ill.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402877.mp3	It’ll be fine my friend.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402878.mp3	I don’t want to discuss it with you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402879.mp3	That can wait.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402880.mp3	That’s the way he should be. Where did he go?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402881.mp3	That’s him. Let’s go.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402882.mp3	Everyone loves you.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402886.mp3	If I had such an opportunity...	dev
common_voice_lv_19402887.mp3	I’ll say.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402888.mp3	Not so good. I’m getting divorced.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402889.mp3	Yes, that sounds good. Thank you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402890.mp3	I’ve never seen you so happy.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402891.mp3	This is proof of what I’ve been saying for over thirty years.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402892.mp3	No, I doubt it... Moreover, it’s at a bad time.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402893.mp3	I don’t think that he can hear you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402894.mp3	That’s right. There’s too much at stake on this game.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402895.mp3	I can’t say that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402896.mp3	Of course. That’s how it should be.	dev

common_voice_lv_19402904.mp3	I hope you’re right.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402905.mp3	You need to talk to me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402906.mp3	He’s got a Chinese accent.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402907.mp3	He rode past me and headed forward.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402908.mp3	She’s great.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402909.mp3	We’ve become friends.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402910.mp3	It increasingly seems to me that they don’t trust you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402911.mp3	You know, it’s funny.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402912.mp3	No, Kārlis. We can get her back.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402913.mp3	It looks like everything’s working out for me, thanks.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402914.mp3	Usually, when it starts to get darker. With darkness.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402915.mp3	He won’t give it to others or take it himself.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402916.mp3	I have to sit down.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402917.mp3	Sly as a fox.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402918.mp3	Misfortune makes you wise.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402920.mp3	The boot is full.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402921.mp3	What did you say?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402922.mp3	Two months ago, he was taken to the precinct for fighting in a cinema.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402923.mp3	Have you ever seen anything like that?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402924.mp3	I’m mad.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402925.mp3	That’s great.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402926.mp3	Please wait for me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402927.mp3	Believe me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402928.mp3	What time do you close?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402929.mp3	Whatever can’t be lifted, can’t be carried.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402930.mp3	Sorry, I can’t.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402931.mp3	Are you going to marry her?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402932.mp3	No, you won’t like that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402933.mp3	Because I was ordered to do so, and I’m ordering you to do so.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402934.mp3	I’d say he doesn’t have a sense of humor.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402935.mp3	I can’t believe my ears.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402936.mp3	What? I’m an asshole?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402937.mp3	That pays for everything.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402938.mp3	I’m going outside.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402939.mp3	You’ll probably meet somebody else.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402940.mp3	Why don’t you like it?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402941.mp3	You must help me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402942.mp3	Dad, can we talk?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402943.mp3	You inscribe good days in stone and bad ones in sand.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402944.mp3	It’s a good job that’s finished.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402945.mp3	Doves symbolize friendship and love.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402946.mp3	Obey mum!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402947.mp3	One tea.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402948.mp3	One of you is acting like a friend.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402949.mp3	I don’t understand why you tolerate it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402950.mp3	Your belly is the boss and you’re the servant.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402951.mp3	The eyes yearn, but the heart says no.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402952.mp3	I’m not well.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402953.mp3	Mother’s is at the end of her tether.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402954.mp3	Did you write that?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402955.mp3	What do you want?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402956.mp3	He who talks a lot, lies a lot.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402957.mp3	After exactly four minutes, I’ll be everywhere.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402958.mp3	We’ve got to get to the hangar.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402959.mp3	No, it’s too late.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402960.mp3	I don’t like eating between meals.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402961.mp3	Never let anybody tell you that he’s better than you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402962.mp3	Get out of the car!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402963.mp3	You’ve organized a fairytale wedding for me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402964.mp3	Can you move that?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402965.mp3	Yes, my lucky little fellow.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402966.mp3	I’m sorry. That’s no fun.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402967.mp3	Sorry, sorry. Does it hurt?	test_dup
common_voice_lv_19402968.mp3	I thought you’d be more fun.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402970.mp3	If your foot was to get stuck under a rock, I’d bite it off to free you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402971.mp3	I don’t have to be able to do a thing. I’m a shit bear.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402972.mp3	I only wanted to have fun for an hour or two.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402973.mp3	Peace nurtures, unrest destroys.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402974.mp3	He’s got my house and my life.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402975.mp3	I’ve got good news.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402976.mp3	One has to admit, you look older.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402977.mp3	Show me the money!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402978.mp3	Amazing. You look like a normal person, but in reality you’re the angel of death.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402979.mp3	I can see that it doesn’t look good.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402980.mp3	That was him! Catch him!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402981.mp3	I don’t understand.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402982.mp3	Nobody’s expecting any proposal.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402983.mp3	That remains to be seen.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402984.mp3	That was damned painful.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402985.mp3	I checked the data. Liepiņš was telling the truth.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402986.mp3	Please be happy.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402987.mp3	Stay well.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402988.mp3	If your dad said that, then he’s forgotten something.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402989.mp3	The building matches its foundations.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402990.mp3	Say hi to your birds from me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402991.mp3	The answer is no.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402992.mp3	I’ll cover you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402994.mp3	He who doesn’t know how to shiver will quickly freeze.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402995.mp3	He who doesn’t know sorrow does not recognise joy.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402996.mp3	It’s in the air!	dev
common_voice_lv_19402997.mp3	We’re going to be friends, okay?	dev
common_voice_lv_19402998.mp3	Where there’s a lot of smoke, there’s little warmth.	dev
common_voice_lv_19402999.mp3	Somehow, you’ve negatively influenced your sister.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403000.mp3	Would you like a sandwich?	dev
common_voice_lv_19403001.mp3	I’d be delighted if, from to time, somebody would give me instructions as to where my life will take me.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403002.mp3	What have you done?	dev
common_voice_lv_19403703.mp3	He just called me and said, “I wanted to know how you’re doing.”	dev
common_voice_lv_19403704.mp3	Ex-celebrity caught with mushrooms.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403705.mp3	We agreed - no gift.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403707.mp3	Ask him.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403708.mp3	The last thing I need is another trigger-happy half-wit!	dev
common_voice_lv_19403743.mp3	Maybe we could hang some small swings from the trees.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403744.mp3	Yes, it looks like a pile of manure.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403745.mp3	I didn’t know that you have a child.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403746.mp3	I’m already starting to feel at home here.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403747.mp3	That’s no soldier, who doesn’t want to become a general.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403748.mp3	It was cold and there was snow on the ground.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403749.mp3	It’s so terrible that it’s not even worth explaining what terrible about it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403750.mp3	Five years ago, we drove together from school to Valmiera	dev
common_voice_lv_19403751.mp3	Of course it was like that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403752.mp3	A dog that barks doesn’t always bite.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403753.mp3	You’re right. That’s why he’s so dangerous!	dev
common_voice_lv_19403754.mp3	Thank you for your choice. Have a good trip.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403755.mp3	Youth doesn’t know, age can’t.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403756.mp3	And it’s yours.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403757.mp3	Have a good evening.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403758.mp3	But you try it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403759.mp3	And he knew: if he found this friend, he would never be separated from him.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403760.mp3	Negotiator.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403761.mp3	I want to take her to a nice place.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403762.mp3	We’ve got soap, don’t we?	dev
common_voice_lv_19403768.mp3	Okay, I’ll reveal my secret.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403769.mp3	Everything will be different, I promise.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403770.mp3	We need to be very careful.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403771.mp3	Not us - you! You’ll stay with mother.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403772.mp3	You are asked to do something dishonest weren’t you?	dev
common_voice_lv_19403778.mp3	There’s a time and a place for everything.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403779.mp3	There’s a map up there on which I’ve marked the places where we could change.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403780.mp3	Quite strange.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403781.mp3	Think in the evening, but do in the morning.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403782.mp3	That’s what I did with mine.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403813.mp3	It depends on what you understand by the word “is”.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403814.mp3	By the way, you’ll write a report about this.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403815.mp3	We had a huge coconut gateau.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403816.mp3	I can sense great fear in you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403817.mp3	He who eats quickly, works quickly.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403828.mp3	Long speeches, short work.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403829.mp3	And you?	dev
common_voice_lv_19403830.mp3	When money talks, the truth remains silent.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403831.mp3	I’d say we’ve got certain potential here.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403832.mp3	Go to Hell, asshole!	dev
common_voice_lv_19403838.mp3	If not than, then I don’t know what else.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403839.mp3	Of course!	dev
common_voice_lv_19403840.mp3	She’s still asleep.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403841.mp3	As if I hadn’t notices that they were advertising beer there.	dev
common_voice_lv_19403842.mp3	That’s great, but do I have to perform in this sill costume?	dev
common_voice_lv_19412931.mp3	Like a rag doll.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412932.mp3	It’s impossible to compare oneself to the oldies.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412933.mp3	You’re trapped, you epauletted wolverine!	dev
common_voice_lv_19412934.mp3	I miss Dārta.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412935.mp3	Because of your tail, you could lose your head.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412996.mp3	He doesn’t sense a thing.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412997.mp3	I wanted to thank you.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412998.mp3	I’ve always known that one has to ready to die doing a policeman’s job.	dev
common_voice_lv_19412999.mp3	They’re flagellating themselves as if they were naked among the nettles.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413000.mp3	To the medical center. Fast!	dev
common_voice_lv_19413006.mp3	How many times do I have to tell you? We’re only friends.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413007.mp3	I’m very sorry.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413008.mp3	That can’t be.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413009.mp3	He’s the author of this article.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413010.mp3	The ambulance is already on its way.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413016.mp3	I’m sitting in the front.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413017.mp3	He’ll be yours, only yours.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413018.mp3	My life has to change.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413020.mp3	Parents?	dev
common_voice_lv_19413022.mp3	If she wants to be like that, so be it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413026.mp3	I’ll be with you with you right away.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413027.mp3	Grief shared is (only) half grief, joy shared is double joy.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413028.mp3	Don’t stick your fingers into hot broth.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413029.mp3	We were together for eight months, I loved her.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413030.mp3	During this period, maybe he should be together with his family.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413031.mp3	He’s enriched our appreciation of acting.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413032.mp3	You see?	dev
common_voice_lv_19413033.mp3	I really like your fragrance.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413034.mp3	I want to buy some boots.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413035.mp3	You mustn’t know that for too long.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413041.mp3	We’ve got to do it.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413042.mp3	I don’t recall it like that.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413043.mp3	I can feel myself growing.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413044.mp3	There’s a time for every job.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413045.mp3	I was simply killing time.	dev
common_voice_lv_19413046.mp3	How I like this dress.	dev
